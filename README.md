Analysis of the results from [GeneticSimulations](https://github.com/Thalla/GeneticSimulations)

**Naming Convention for data files**  
config6FactL2029Out0120RandAndMaxL2029Out0110.RData  
config6Fact -> can be anything that describes the dataset in short  
The following was simulated with translation type "affinity"  
L2029 -> parameter livingAarsSeed had values from 20 to 29  
Out0120 -> parameter outputSeed had values from 1 to 20  
RandAndMax -> the following was simulated with translation types "random" and "max"  
L2019 -> parameter livingAarsSeed had values from 20 to 29 
Out0110 -> parameter outputSeed had values from 1 to 10  

All in all, every simulated parameter combination was simulated with ten different living aaRSs seeds and ten different output seeds.  
The parameter combinations with translation type "affinity" were simulated with ten additional output seeds.
