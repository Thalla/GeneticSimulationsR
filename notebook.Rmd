xtable is for making latex tables from r objects

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. 

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
require(ggplot2)
options(digits = 16) # Nachkommastellen (#Stellen)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo=FALSE, cache = TRUE)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
